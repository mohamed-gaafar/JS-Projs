## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**:
   - The game begins by displaying all the letters of the alphabet on the screen.
   - You are given a **hint** (e.g., "Famous football player" or "Arab countries") and the number of letters in the hidden word.
   
2. **Guess the Letters**:
   - Click on the letters you think are part of the word.
   - Correct guesses reveal the letters in their respective positions in a **guessing word box** displayed below the alphabet.
   - Wrong guesses add parts to the hangman figure.

3. **Game Progress**:
   - Continue guessing letters based on the hint and revealed letters.
   - If you complete the word before the hangman is fully drawn, **you win**!
   - If the hangman drawing is completed before you guess the word, **you lose**.
