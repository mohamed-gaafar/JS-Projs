## How It Works

1. **Categories and Questions**:
   - Each quiz is organized under a specific **category name** (e.g., Science, History, Sports).
   - Questions are presented one at a time, each with multiple-choice options.

2. **Answering Questions**:
   - Select the correct answer from the MCQs.
   - Click the **Submit** button to confirm your choice and proceed to the next question.

3. **Timer for Each Question**:
   - A **countdown timer** is displayed for each question.
   - If the timer runs out, the current question is marked as missed, and the quiz proceeds to the next question.

4. **Progress Indicators**:
   - **Question Counter**: Displays the current question number out of the total number of questions (e.g., "Question 3 of 10").
   - **Circles at the Bottom**: Represent the total number of questions. The color of each circle changes dynamically based on the status:
     - **Unanswered**: Default color.
     - **Correct**: Green.
     - **Incorrect**: Red.
